Debug Info Format
-----------------

- 4 Operation Bytecode


- 0 w x y z -> interpret w x y z as a big-endian i32, and add it to the line offset


- x when x < 65 -> add x to line offset


- x when x < 129 -> subtract 64 from x and subtract it from the line offset


- x -> subtract 129 from x, multiply it by the quanta of the instruction size 1 on x86_64), and add it to the pc


after every opcode, add the quanta of the instruction size to the pc

example: TODO
