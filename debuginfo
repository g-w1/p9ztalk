Debug Info Format
------------------------

- 4 Operation Bytecode VM

- 2 Variables
	Line Count = 0
	Program Counter = Start of Text Section (can only increase)

- 0 w x y z 		-> interpret w x y z as a big-endian i32, and add it to the
				     line offset
- x when x < 65 	-> add x to line offset
- x when x < 129 	-> subtract 64 from x and subtract it from the line offset
- x 				-> subtract 129 from x, multiply it by the min instruction
				     size, and add it to the pc

after every opcode, add the quanta of the instruction size to the pc
